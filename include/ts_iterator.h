/**
 * Interface for the thread-safe Iterator ADT.
 *
 * An iterator over a collection of elements.
 *
 * This iterator is returned from all of the iterator() methods and contains a shallow copy of all
 * the items in the structure it's iterating from; therefore, the items returned from the iterator
 * should be accessed in a read-only manner. The iterator itself is a `snapshot` iterator - the
 * items contained in the iterator represent the structure's current state. Any changes made to the
 * structure after creating the iterator will not be reflected.
 *
 * Modeled after the Java 7 Iterator interface.
